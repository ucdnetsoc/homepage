### Installing Git

[Official Git release](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

[GitHub Desktop Client](https://desktop.github.com/)

### Youtube courses

All you need to know in one tutorial - [Git and GitHub for poets - Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV)

If you need a short refresher on git bash, I recommend this video: [Learn Git in 20 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9XZQO1n_7c)

If you want to get a more in depth look at git, see: [Advanced GIT for developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duqBHik7nRo)

### Common commands and operations

[Command line cheat sheet](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)

If you know what you need to do, but don't know how to do it, here are some good resources. Firstly, a shoutout to **Google** and **Stack Overflow**. Without the help of these two, learning Git would be a lot more difficult.

The [GitHub help pages](https://help.github.com/) has a lot of good short tutorials, including: [Setting up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/), [Cloning a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/), and [Uploading your repository using the command line](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/).

If you have messed up your repository, this guide is priceless: [On undoing, fixing, or removing commits in git](http://sethrobertson.github.io/GitFixUm/fixup.html).

### Official reference

If you are more technically oriented, or you just want to torture yourself, you might want to check out the [official reference](https://git-scm.com/).
